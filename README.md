Raspberry Pi Vcgencmd
=============================

A small python library to programmatically access some of the internal
sensors of the Raspberry Pi

## Usage

Todo add this section

## Todo

* The first time vcgencmd is requested to run it should run
and then check what commands are available on that Raspberry Pi.
This should then confirm that the command is available and also
stop any commands which are not available on the Pi.
* Combine some of the output functions so that it doesnt use several
different formatting methods
